start="379.5" dur="3.479">think some guys struggle with this</text><text start="380.94" dur="4.199">because it&amp;#39;s just such a core part of</text><text start="382.979" dur="4.44">their masculine

a</text><text start="398.94" dur="4.44">question of my own how is it kind to</text><text start="401.1" dur="4.2">yourself to continue to support a woman</text><text start="403.38" dur="4.14">emotionally and financially who you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="405.3" dur="4.56">not even dating all of that time and</text><text start="407.52" dur="4.5">money that you&amp;#39;re

dur="4.199">her victories were your victories and it</text><text start="416.039" dur="4.201">made sense to support each other because</text><text start="418.139" dur="4.261">when she wins you wins I get that but</text><text start="420.24" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s over now it&amp;#39;s time for her to look</text><text start="422.4" dur="4.32">after herself and for you to look after</text><text start="424.38" dur="4.2">yourself and if you&amp;#39;re falling victim to</text><text start="426.72" dur="3.599">like guilt trips like she&amp;#39;s trying to</text><text start="428.58" dur="4.02">guilt you saying things like why aren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="430.319" dur="4.261">you paying my rent anymore you know I I</text><text start="432.6" dur="4.8">can&amp;#39;t afford the place like this like</text><text start="434.58" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t you care about me oh you can</text><text start="437.4" dur="4.44">safely ignore that because she has</text><text start="439.56" dur="4.44">revealed that she doesn&amp;#39;t care about you</text><text start="441.84" dur="4.259">a woman who cares about you and what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="444" dur="4.38">right for you would not be asking for</text><text start="446.099" dur="4.561">free money she would feel guilty about</text><text start="448.38" dur="4.2">taking up your time about taking up your</text><text
